# cryptocurrencies

## Summary

For this challenge I took a CSV with all the available crypto currencies and transformed the data to be inputted into an unsupervised machine learning model then produced some visualizations with results. First, we transformed the data to make sure that the crypto was being traded, that it had an algorithm, and that it had over 0 coins mined. from there I used a scaler to scale all the number to be closer in range then created a data frame with three principal components. Finally, we fed that into the Kmeans model with k = 4. Then created some nice visualizations to show the results. Images of the visualizations below.
